# Neon-Shapes

This shader generates dynamic neon shapes with vibrant colors. It utilizes a palette function to create a range of colors based on time. The main shape in this shader is a circle, but you can easily modify it to create different shapes by adjusting the parameters. The colors and patterns evolve over time, creating an animated and visually appealing effect.
